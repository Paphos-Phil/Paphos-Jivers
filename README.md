Hi, we are a small (40'odd) dance group in Paphos, Cyprus, set up to promote partnered dancing called Modern Jive.  We meet every Tuesday in Spetember through to June, in Chloraka in Paphos.  If you have an interest in partnered dancing (like Salsa, but Modern Jive is simpler) then please join us, we run a Beginners lesson at 7pm every Tuesday.

Lessons are €3, with Guests €5 if not a member of the P3A (very recommended) Join the P3A at www.paphos3rdage.org, and get access to their many activities, including dancing, in the Paphos region.
